We are scoping interest in a new qualification in Data Science. Broadly, we would like our graduates to be able to take a data set, ask the right questions of that data and be able to produce from it a data product which enables useful action.

At this very early stage, the shape and content of the course is very fluid, but a strong possibility is that we offer a full-time, two year HE qualification known as a Foundation Degree, which is broadly equivalent to the fist two years of a bachelors degree.

On completion of the course learners could either seek employment or, possibly, complete their honours degree in the BSc Data Analytics and Modelling.

A possible outline course design is shown below.

I would be very interested in any comments you have regarding this outline design, but also in whether you think

* there is demand for the skills taught in this course, at the level that someone could reach after two years of full-time study.
* there is demand, but this course has some serious omissions, which are...
* there is demand, but even if the course were OK, graduates from Cornwall College would not get employment in this field because.....
