We are scoping interest in a new qualification in Data Science. Broadly, we would like our graduates to be able to take a data set, ask the right questions of that data and be able to produce from it a data product which enables useful action. The data might be in the form of spreadsheets, or large, messy and require the use of cloud based solutions.

At this very early stage, the shape and content of the course is very fluid, but a strong possibility is that we offer a full-time, two year HE qualification known as a Foundation Degree, which is broadly equivalent to the fist two years of a bachelors degree.



On completion of the course learners could either seek employment or, possibly, complete their honours degree in the BSc Data Analytics and Modelling.

A possible outline course design is shown below.

I would be very interested in any comments you have regarding this outline design, in particular on:

* Do you think there is demand for the skills taught in this course, at the level that someone could reach after two years of full-time study.
* Where do you think this demand lies ie who needs these graduates
* Do you think this course has some serious omissions, which are...
* Do you think there is demand, but to attract students the course would need a USP which would be...
